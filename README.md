nfc_outlet
==========

This is a project that allows for someone to restrict access to a traditional 120 volt outlet. It consists of an Android application that authenticates to the outlet. It also has some Java and Arduino code. Both platforms were used as controllers to the actual outlet. Then there is some PHP code that was used to manage the permissions for the outlet.
